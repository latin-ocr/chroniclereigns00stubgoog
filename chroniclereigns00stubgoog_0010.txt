On the nuth of Ianuary 1857, the Moster of the Rolls
submitted to the lbeasury a proposal for the publication
ot materiols for the History ot this country from the
Invasion oi the Romans to the Beign of Henry VIII.

The Master of the Rolls suggested that these materiols
should be selected ior publication under competent
editors without reference to periodical or chronological
arrangement, without mutilation or abridgment, preter·
enee being given, in the first instance, to such materiale
as were most scaroe and valuable.

He proposed that each chronicle or historioal docu-
ment to be edited should be treated in the same way as
if the editor were engaged on an Editio Princeps; and
ior this purpose the most correct text should be formed
from an accurate collation oi the best MSS.

llo render the work more generally useful, the Master
oi the Rolls suggested that the editor should give an
account of the MSS. employed by him, of their age and
their peculiarities3 thot he should add to the work a
brief account of the life and times of the author, and any
remarks necessary to explain the chronology ; but no
other note or comment was to be allowed, except what

might be necessary to establish the correctness of the
text.
