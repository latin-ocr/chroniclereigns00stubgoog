It may be fairly a matter of conjecture whether this &magro
panthal alu-ogation of the tax was owing ιο a wish on ιιι ¹⁸¹·
Henry's part ιο prove himself a wortby successor of the
Confessor, or ιο a conuiction that it was an unprofitable,
unpopnlar, and impolitic impost, a small portion only of
which reached the exobequer·; or whether the facts that
during the years of Becket’s chancellorship the Dane-

geld was not exacted, that in the year of his resignation

it reappears, and that in the following year, aster a stout
resistance on his part, it was finassy ffisused, point to

the second martyr of Oanterbury ns the real deliverer
from tbe tax, which in its first form the first martyr os
canarbury, St Elpbege, hed resisted ιο the death.

The carucege which was levied by Richard I. in his
eighth year was, however, ιο all intents and pumosee a
rewiwal of this odious impost.

The next item of ancient revenue was tue donum,or111.noe
auxilinm, names which bear evidence ιο their original iniimus&
nature of contributione ιγ the vassaln to assist the neces-
sities of their lorde. The former term is applied to the
sums raised by the enunties, the latter ιο those by the
towns This impost varied in amount on occasion, and
there is no reason ιο suppose that it was an annual tarn
It seems to bave answered ιο what was known aomewhat -
later by the name of talliage‚ and in tbe thirty-first of
Henry 1. appears only in the form of auxilium burgorum,
being probably intended ιο be to the towns what Dane-
geld was tc the country.

The second year of Henry II. was marked by sumamma
variatione from the older practice, which may be ascribed ¹¹⁸⁶
with tolerable certainty to the advice of Becket as chan·
cellon It was no doubt a year of extraordinary charges,
and one in whicb the more elastic methods of raising a
ravenue by making up the arrears of legal prooeedings
could not be brought into effectiva working. We
find in it accordingly the disappearance of Danegeld,
coupled with the new arrangement of the donum,
