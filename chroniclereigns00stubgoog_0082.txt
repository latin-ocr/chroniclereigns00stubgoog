“ question should come up amongst theru, which could
“ not be brought 10 sn end by them, 11 should be pre-

It is by no means eeey to determine the exact 10100 01
this measure. It seems impossible 10 doubt that the
eighteen were identical withthe judges 01110 year 1176,
and that the intention was to prevent them from siit-ing
in the Curis Regis. .1f the measure 01 1176 really added
largely to the number 01 110 junges, end was not merely
a resrrangement 0111011 functione, there oen be no doubt
that the increased number was burdensome, and that
the king intended to establish a new tribunsl 01 five, to
the exclusion 01 the rest. Accordingly the measure has
been understood with great probability to imply the
erectiones 0 bank or bench in the Curia, to which the
title 01 Curia Regis subsequently became restricted, and
which is the original 01 110 present Court 01 King's
Bench.

But it seems probable that this 001 was attended by
110 deposition 01 most 01 the eighte'en from their judicia]
functione altogether, 01 their relegation to subordinate
plaoos in the Exchequer, 101 110 11010 were served in

were new appointments; whilst on the redistribution 01
