the only conclusion we can come ιο is that the rolls ere

on sadly incomplete; but there is a soundness in the sum

⁸⁸ that tempto e doubt. By Robert de Monte we erc told

that the scutage cf the king’s foreign dominicns was

sixty shillings Angevin¹ ιο the knight’s fec. If we sup·

pose that Gervase had simply calculated the English

sentage et sixty shillinge sterling, the sum raised on

60,000 knights' fees would cf course be exactly 180,000l.

We know, however, thet the sum was two contributione

of two marks, thet is sl 130. sd. ιο the see. This would

raiae 160,000l. in the grece But if the amount actually

raised in the ssventh year corresponded with that cf the

fifth, the whole was note fifth of that sum Itis, how·

ever, impossible to come ιο an exact conclusion without

fuller duta than exist even in the rolls themselves. We

dc not know either the real number of knights' fees in
England, cr the number on which the tax was levied.

manner by scutsge and tallicge, but owing ιο several
