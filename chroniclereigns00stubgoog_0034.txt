Both of theee riewe heve been edvooeted, the 'flret by nme«
eome of hie oontemporeriee, end thoee who in inter timeo men
heve eppmeehed the history from their point of preju-
dioe ; the letter by thoee who, both eneiently end
reoently‚ heve been inclined ιο look with ιοο professionel
en eye on the character of hie reform. I heve eteted
nlreedy thet 1 think neither of them teneble; end ee it
ie et present Henry'e pereonel ehereeter thet ie before
me, Ι will give the reeeonn

Ae ιο ιιο firet theory, which, in the menthe of hie (1) rede

oontemporeriee, seems eo oondemnetory, it must be eeid dm
thet gratuitoue herentes wee no pert of Henry’e ohe· ltili· π
meter, if we mey jndge by hie notione. He που
thoroughly uneorupuloue end unprinoipled, but he wne
not e tyrent; he wne not wentonly eruel or oppreeeive.
Hie orimee egeinet publio lew end order, euch ne they
were, were not purpoeeleee, nor ie it in eny wey neoee·
eery ιο enppoee thet he hed that intolerenoe of ell
opposition whioh purenee tyrenny for ite own eeke. He
hed definite eime, end followed them unrelentingly3
whatever oould be mede ιο minister ιο their fintherenee

tirnee oompelled ιο give wey to the oooeeionel exigeneiee
of hir great deeign But where there wee no definite
object, he wer not ο tyrent.

The theory thet he war e benet-olent governor or e (enm

apperent pnrpoee of hie reforme, or by their eeturd reeult. weit«.
It requires no pertlouhr benevolenee to teeoh n king
thet hie subjecte ere more eontented when juetiee ie feirly
administered then when violenee reigne unrepreeeed;
end thet where they ere eontented, they ere more
likely ιο be industrioue, end more able ιο pey texee;
thet where they hewemore et eteke, they ere more ready

to melre eaorilieee to purcheee eeourity; but thie ie no

leeeon of fer-eighted eteteemenehip, for it ie the eimpleet
