The works to bo published in octavo, separately, as
they were finished; the whole responsibility ol tho usk
testing upon the editors, who were to be ohosen by the
Master of the Rolls with the sanction of the lheasury.

The Lords of Her Majesty's Treasury, alter a earehrl
eonsiderstion of the subjeot, expressed their opinion in a
lhoasmy Minute, dated February 9, 1857, that the plau
reoommended bytho Master ol the Rolls “was well
oaloulated for the aooomplishment ol this importent
rational object, in an effeetual and satisfaotory manner,
within a reasonable time, and provided proper attention
be paid to eoonomy, in making the detsiled arrange·
ments, without unneoessary expense.’'

They expressed their approbation of the proposal that
eaoh ohroniole and historioal document should be edited
in such a manner as to represent with all possible oor·
reotness the text of eaoh writer, derived from s collation
of the bost Mes, and that no notes should be added,
exoept suoh as were illustralive of the various readings.
They suggested, however, that the prefaoe to eaoh work
should oontain, in addition to the particulars proposed
by the Master of the Rolls, a biographioal aooount ol
the author, so for as authentis materials existed for that
purpose, and an estimate of his historioal eredibilityand
velue.
