Prcviouely to 1178 cll the membcrc oi the Ouric Regis Qffltbn

Now it would appear that the centrcl jurisdiction was
entructedto c single committee oi five. Ac the uix
who uere appointed in necrly the cume words, the sol-
lowing year, tc bc jucticcc of the Curia Regin„ were uppu-
rently different persons from thece five, with the excep·
tion of Gluuvill, we may infer tbct the appointmcnt of
thiu committec 'vus un annual cr even c termincl oue,
und thut the judgee of the Ouric in thiu new form, or,
uc uc muy cull them, the jucticec of the bench, were c
temporury selection from the whole body of judgec‚ who

still dioehuged the officec of itinercnt jucticoe and

barone of the exchequer. Thut the itincrunt juctioec
did not loce their places in the cxcbuquer isclecr, from
the tect that their names appear in the lictu oi persone

We heve unfortunately no account of further changes
in the constitution of the Ourin Regis during this reign,
